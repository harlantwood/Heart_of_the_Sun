Act 1
=====

1. We move deeply through the intricate web of SunOne, a living breathing space station, undulating around the furnace of our Sun. Zoom and weave through this amazing tapestry of lives and to find... Miriam. Miriam is meditating. Staring at the sun, perfect lotus position, floating naked in empty space, Miriam is meditating, with the beatific innocence of a teenage angel.

2. Naidan works alone in crude utilitarian VR in Organic Intelligence Project (OIP) data space, handling information requests and life system operations in his sector. Vast complexity of information tasks flashes by - interrupted by a priority request from an OIP citizen.

3. Ananda, a beautiful amazon angel, is the receptionist at the shining gate of the TransHumanTechnology Corporation. Fadi arrives, an arrogant OIP kid, eager to defect to the immortals; Ananda greets him like an old friend. <small>[[Read full scene]](../Heart_of_the_Sun_-_Scene_-_TransHumanTechnologyCorp_Gatehouse)</small>  

4. Ananda carries Fadi, flying gracefully over a lush natural landscape. They land and witness a spectacular transformation scene in Eden, which Fadi dismisses as an advertisement; they fly on.

5. Ananda introduces Fadi to Grant, who gives him the keys to the immortal technology he will need to digitize his consciousness, and emigrate. Grant tries to warn Fadi about the risks of awakening the OIPs -- like Naidan.

6. As he runs simulations for Fadi's defection, Naidan runs shadow sims of his own escape plans. Each simulation results in permanent termination of his consciousness within 99.9% certainty.

7. SunOne's annual Meeting of the Keys - a global re-visioning of SunOne. Quinn, a military scientist and renaissance man, is delivering a keynote address; he is interrupted by violent images that foreshadow the destruction to come.

8. Break between sessions. Senai, a seer, has no eyes. The connection between Quinn and Naidan intensifies; Naidan dreaming, Quinn rocked by the dark visions. Naidan's dream ends with Quinn saying "The heart of the Sun".

9. Naidan wakes with luminous clarity around him -- prepares his consciousness and shoots himself as a laser signal directly toward the Sun, just as the OIP feds break down Fadi's door, and mindwipe Naidan's brain.

10. We follow the laser burst, hurtling toward the sun at the speed of light.

Act 2
=====

11. Quinn, flying alone, sees the laser signal coming, swallows it whole. Naidan violently takes over Quinn's body, total power.

12. Naidan raging through Quinn's military-grade tech body, battling SunOne security forces. Modern battle rages: bodies that split into nanotech swarms; soldiers who suck up tech from the space stations they crash into; enemies seen through targeting systems; tech maps like massive tree systems; eventually, Naidan is overpowered and captured.

13. At the Council of the Sun, Factimus, a hardened military man, wants to terminate Quinn immediately, military secrets must be preserved; it could be the enemy infecting Quinn. The vote is a tie, so it is broken by council member Quinn himself, channeled by Marta, who voted against Factimus. Breaking Marta's heart, Quinn votes to preserve SunOne at all costs, including his own death.

14. Factimus, Miriam's military superior, turns up at the climax of her death ritual; tells her that Quinn will be terminated, he's compromised, too dangerous. Miriam is pissed.

15. Martin in his archetype workshop, plugging the light of spiritual realms into his algorithms, creating liquid moving sculptures, totally high. Sarah, his winged assistant, warns him that Miriam is calling; his delicate creations collapse as Miriam hauls him out of VR.

16. Martin's lab is in emergency mode, destruction everywhere. Miriam tells Martin that Quinn is to be killed.

17. Miriam, Martin and Thurman burst through layers of SunStation tech, smashing out a technologically crucified Naidan/Quinn. They hit the silence of space, then are snatched up by the massive geodesic black ball of their ship, Diamond 11.

18. Piloted by Baz, the team heads to Miriam's research station, pursued by Factimus' fighters, which target them but do not attack.

19. Naidan on this massive crucifix of light; they are doing this ritual invocation to try to land Quinn back in his body; Naidan burns. The crystal temple starts falling, chunks smashing down to the floor, exploding. Martin loses it, attacks Naidan; Naidan smashes out of his cage; he punches Miriam through the wall, into space near the Sun.

20. Miriam laughs, suddenly loving the game; she tacks into the sun, Naidan following lumbering dark bird, screeching. They dive deep into the Sun, battling and hissing like cats, he is fucking her, she is opening him up to the light of the Sun.

21. Deep in the Sun, Quinn's body spits out Naidan, caught by Factimus in a low power droid body. Naidan is destroyed, lost little boy.

22. Factimus is binding Naidan, Quinn demands Naidan's release, calling Naidan his brother.

23. The SunOne crew hold Naidan like a baby, crying softly, unbelieving, loved.

Act 3
=====

24. As Miriam's crew take Naidan back to the OIP, they explain to him why they need to get his living body back: a primer on the human spirit. Naidan just wants to go to the immortals, but finally agrees to try his own body.

25. The crew sneaks Naidan's body onto the ship. Out of site, Naidan injects something into the OIP Operators' feed tubes.

26. They prepare droid-Naidan for bridging with his flesh-body, while being rocked by missiles from the OIP. Massive medical catastrophe; flesh-Naidan dies in droid-Naidan's arms.

27. Naidan pounding on his flesh-body's chest with his metal fists, zapping the body again and again, they pull him off like a madman. In rage, then utterly defeated, droid-Naidan lays down in a growing pool of his own blood, lays his head on his body's belly, and switches off his own power, master switch at the throat.

28. In the wreckage of RS126, they wake up Naidan. Miriam is dancing her death ritual; unprecedented phoenix transmission; creating a new body for Naidan. Rendered glorious like a god, infused with Miriam's connection, Naidan is reunited with Quinn as brothers, equals. Quinn has lost Miriam, bittersweet.

29. In the middle of the credits, the OIP Operators tear down your regularly scheduled programming... to bring you the new world order... ultimatum: if terms are not accepted, citizen life support will be terminated at 0800 hours. Have a nice sleep.
