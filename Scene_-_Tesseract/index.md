<div class="title">Tesseract</div> 

<div class="description">Research Station 126</div> 
<div class="description">A crystal temple that is Miriam's home, glorious. Naidan, crucified on this massive slab of tech, metal, light. The other four form a circle around him, Miriam directly in front of Naidan, eye contact. As they hold the stillness, the intensity builds, and tiny threads of light bursts through the ceiling, hitting Naidan directly on the top of the head. Naidan writhes in pain.</div> 
<div class="speaker">NAIDAN</div> 
<div class="dialog_line">(Regaining control) You can't win you know.</div> 
<div class="speaker">MARTIN</div> 
<div class="dialog_line">How does it feel to burn?</div> 
<div class="speaker">QUINN</div> 
<div class="dialog_line">We are forming subspace alliances with postmatter intelligences you can't imagine. The power is...extreme.</div> 
<div class="speaker">THURMAN</div> 
<div class="dialog_line">You have Marcia Savik.</div> 
<div class="speaker">NAIDAN</div> 
<div class="dialog_line">Marcia... has endured a lot. She has been broken and broken and broken.</div> 
<div class="speaker">THURMAN</div> 
<div class="dialog_line">And for what? (Suddenly taken by rage) For what?</div> 
<div class="speaker">NAIDAN</div> 
<div class="dialog_line">For immortality.</div> 
<div class="speaker">MARTIN</div> 
<div class="dialog_line">Ah the new religion.</div> 
<div class="speaker">NAIDAN</div> 
<div class="dialog_line">You...suicide cults are the only remaining threat to the emerging posthuman civilization. You teach your children to die.</div> 
<div class="speaker">THURMAN</div> 
<div class="dialog_line">We're a threat?</div> 
<div class="speaker">MARTIN</div> 
<div class="dialog_line">Yeah, they might start meditating and forget to torture people.</div> 
<div class="description">Naidan's personality changes, and Quinn speaks.</div> 
<div class="speaker">QUINN</div> 
<div class="dialog_line">Miriam, hear me.</div> 
<div class="speaker">MIRIAM</div> 
<div class="dialog_line">Hey Quinn! We're coming for you!</div> 
<div class="speaker">NAIDAN</div> 
<div class="dialog_line">Your friend is already dead.</div> 
<div class="description">Miriam raises her right hand, and a deluge of light pours down upon Naidan, blinding.</div> 
<div class="speaker">MARTIN</div> 
<div class="dialog_line">How does it feel to burn?</div> 
<div class="speaker">MIRIAM</div> 
<div class="dialog_line">Martin, shut up and hold the ritual.</div> 
<div class="description">Chunks are beginning to pop out of the ceiling, smashing down on the floor like blocks of glass, exploding.</div> 
<div class="speaker">NAIDAN</div> 
<div class="dialog_line">Martin's just jealous... He thinks Quinn doesn't know that you fucked him Miriam, that you fuck him every time Quinn goes somewhere.</div> 
<div class="description">Martin is behind Quinn; he whips his necklace around Quinn in a fluid motion and chokes him. Baz and Thurman leap for Martin, but he hits them with bolts of light from his hands, and they recoil stunned. Miriam dives at Martin as he renews his strangulation efforts, Naidan straining against his bonds, trying to reach Martin.</div> 
<div class="speaker">MIRIAM</div> 
<div class="dialog_line">Martin, stop!</div> 
<div class="description">With a scream, Naidan wrenches the whole crucifix out of the floor, spins, wrapping Martin, necklace, nanofilament brain enhancement around the cross, spinning faster and faster, tearing Martin's brain.</div> 
<div class="speaker">MIRIAM</div> 
<div class="dialog_line">Quinn!</div> 
<div class="speaker">BAZ</div> 
<div class="dialog_line">Whatever's inhabiting Quinn's body has just transmitted three sets of military-grade private keys, Quinn's, Miriam's and Martin's. Enough to bring our defenses to her knees. I've warned Xerez, but it may already be too late.</div> 
<div class="speaker">NAIDAN</div> 
<div class="dialog_line">Of course it's too late.</div> 
<div class="description">Naidan smashes his cage into the walls, into the bodies, into Miriam, smashes, and the cage becomes his, the metal and tech becomes dark wings. He lunges at Miriam, they punch through the wall, into space near the Sun.</div>
