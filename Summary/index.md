In the year 2202, immortality is free, poverty and war are distant memories, everyone who wants to be is a full-time creator. And only the spiritually committed choose to die.

On Earth, artificial minds head the world’s power centers. Human-speed thought is an anachronism, corporations are born, merge and conquer each other at billions per second and scientific breakthroughs tear through paradigms daily.

The ultimate gift is bestowed upon humans by the Transhuman Technology Corporation: physical immortality, with an ever-evolving range of sophisticated artificial bodies. AI/Human symbiosis is indistinguishable: humans upload their minds at will to software, and AI’s control post-human bodies. The company’s free immersive entertainment programs, dismissed by their detractors as mere advertisements, are nevertheless among the most popular sentient media in the solar system. Cultural prosperity reigns: everyone who wants to be is a creator, for it is the shining age of the artist, scientist, philosopher, and intellectual. The termination of a sentient mind, human or machine, is a crime of the highest order.

SunOne is a living space station dancing a divine web around the Sun, housing a synergy of humans and spiritually presenced artificial intelligence. Within, genetic engineering is of awesome dimension, for bodies built with DNA-level organic computational abilities are distributed throughout and every cell is a distributed processing unit. 

SunOne’s citizens are born into human bodies, though as teenagers they choose whether to engage a 7 year cycle of spiritualized  bodymorphing: a process with special attention toward keeping intact the human body’s subtle energies while gradually replacing the human cells with powerful nanotech machinery. Physical immortality is easy, but SunOne denizen mostly choose to die every 100 to 1000 years or so. They do so in order to return to spiritual worlds and enter the regenerative “sleep” between lifetimes. On Earth, the immortals look at SunOne as a pathological suicide cult that teaches its children to kill themselves. On SunOne, immortality is seen as a  dangerously gilded cage of delusion.

Against this backdrop is Miriam, a 200 year old artist and warrior in the body of a goddess. The story begins as she is creating a massive artwork to the sun as a final parting gift before dying. She is as close as any living system has ever been to the Sun. She meditates and weaves in awe as mathematical revelations blossom like lotus petals around her goddess body...
