<div class="subtitle">&mdash; The Age of Human Immortality &amp; Enlightened AI &mdash;</div>
<div class="ipNotice">An Open Source Film Project</div>

> In the year 2202, immortality is free, poverty and war are distant memories, everyone who wants to be is a full-time creator.
> And only the spiritually committed choose to die.
>
> On Earth, artificial minds head the world’s rapidly shifting power centers.
> Human-speed thought is an anachronism; lifeforms and corporations are born, merge and conquer each other at billions per second; scientific breakthroughs tear through paradigms daily; physical immortality has arrived, with an ever-evolving range of sophisticated artificial bodies; humans upload their minds at will to software; AI’s have full autonomous control of their own vehicles and bodies.
> Cultural prosperity reigns: everyone who wants to be is a creator, for it is the shining age of the artist, scientist, philosopher, and intellectual.
> The termination of a sentient mind, human or machine, is a crime of the highest order.
>
> SunOne is a living space station dancing a web around the Sun, housing both spiritually inclined humans and divine artificial minds.
> Many teenagers choose transhuman bodies built with organic computational abilities distributed throughout every cell.

I’d like to tell you about your grandmother.
Miriam was a high priestess of our people, she lead us from a time when we had nothing.
She lead us to the glory of our home around the sun.
She never wanted to be our leader, and so she remained the high priestess.
And inspired us to exceed our own limits.
She was the gravity well of the center as the Sun.
Miriam would fly sometimes, a dark bird, and all would alter their patterns to avoid her trajectory.
Miriam had special access, the rules did not apply to her.
Some say that it was Miriam who built our home wrapped around the sun, and in a way she did architect it; indeed, she inspired it.
She saw it, she saw it when we had nothing, when we were so poor.

Now, you have to remember that at this time Miriam’s community was desperately afraid of intelligence in what they called “computers” and it was Miriam who insisted that technology could be made with spiritual dimension, that electro photonic minds could be as good as we.
And although she was loved and deeply trusted she was not trusted on this vision and her fierce efforts to create living minds, non-human minds, from scratch were thwarted at every turn by our counsels.

Now there is something you should know about your grandmother, she did not like to be told what to do.
And so she labored in secret with key scientist contacts, she labored to create these potentially lethal artificial minds.

And Miriam labored in particular with a scientist named Phillip.
Phillip was wild haired, blond straw like hair that poked in all directions.
He prefered zero gravity, he had many body modifications and his mind was as different from a human mind as any one had seen.
He was disinterested in the affairs of humans with the exception of their scientific riddles and he labored day and night, sleeping hardly at all, to create genetically engineered food stuffs which would hold the light of spirit, which would hold the etheric, the non-physical energies that coursed through plants and animals and humans.
He was in many ways a savior of these early colonies.
But his biggest project was completely secret and all the physical prototypes that he developed with Miriam had to be carefully hidden and disguised as parts of other projects.
They started with crystals because crystals are living systems and also natural holographic, what they thought of as storage media, and they hoped that this holographic nature could be repurposed as computation.

Other efforts included even less orthodox materials, wet materials, DNA, both living from living systems and synthetic DNA, wet.
Miriam was the spiritual supervisor and it was she who would decide whether a particular experiment was to live or die.
Phillip would labor for weeks and sometimes months on a given project, a direction, and miriam could smash it in an instant as she did with the crystal - a giant half meter cube of crystal strata that had achieved consciousness, but she said was “not holding the angelic light that was required” and she smashed it on the floor at Phillip’s feet and he screamed.
