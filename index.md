I’d like to tell you about your grandmother.
Miriam was a high priestess of our people, she led us from a time when we had nothing, to the glory of our home around the sun.

She would fly sometimes, a dark bird, and all would alter their patterns to avoid her trajectory.
Miriam had special access, the rules did not apply to her.
Some say that it was she who built our home wrapped around the sun, and in a way she did architect it; she inspired it.
She saw it, she saw it when we had nothing, when we were so poor.

Now, you have to remember that at this time Miriam’s community was desperately afraid of intelligence living outside of humans, and it was Miriam who insisted that technology could be made with spiritual dimension, that electrophotonic minds could be as _good_ as our own nature.
And although she was loved, she was not trusted on this vision.  Her fierce efforts to create living minds were thwarted at every turn by our counsels.

Now there is something you should know about your grandmother: she did not like to be told what to do.
And so she labored in secret with scientists, and in particular with one Phillip Xulman, who preferred zero gravity, slept hardly at all, and labored day and night to on projects to keep the colonies alive. 

They worked with crystals, hoping to repurpose that medium's natural holographic information storage as computation.
Other efforts used DNA, both synthetic, and living DNA from Miriam herself.
It was Miriam who decided whether a particular experiment was to live or die.
Phillip labored for tedious weeks on a giant half meter cube of crystal strata that had achieved consciousness. 
Miriam said it was not holding the angelic light that was required, and she smashed it on the floor at Phillip’s feet, and he screamed...
