In the year 2202, immortality is free, poverty and war are distant memories, everyone who wants to be is a full-time creator.  And only the really spiritually committed choose to die. 

On Earth, artificial minds head the world's power centers; human-speed thought is an anachronism; corporations are born, merge and conquer each other at billions per second. Scientific breakthroughs tear through paradigms daily. The Transhuman Technology Corporation, godlike, bestows upon humans the ultimate gift: physical immortality, with an ever-evolving range of increasingly sophisticated artificial bodies. The company's free immersive entertainment programs, dismissed by their detractors as mere advertisements, are nevertheless among the most popular sentient media in the solar system. AI/Human symbiosis to the point where they are indistinguishable: humans upload their minds at will to software, and AI's control posthuman bodies. Cultural prosperity reigns: everyone who wants to is a creator: shining age of artists, scientists, philosophers, intellectuals.  The termination of a sentient mind, human or machine, is a crime of the highest order.

SunOne: a living breathing space station, dancing a divine web around the Sun, a synergy of humans and spiritually presenced artificial intelligence. Genetic engineering of awesome dimension: bodies with built in DNA-level organic computational abilities distributed throughout; every cell a processing unit. SunOne's citizens are all born into human bodies. As teenagers, they can choose whether to engage a 7 year cycle of spiritualized OneMetal bodymorphing, the gradual replacement of the human cells with powerful nanotech machinery, a process with special attention toward keeping intact the human body's subtle energies.  Physical immortality is easy, but SunOne denizen mostly choose to die, every 100 or 1000 years or so. They do so in order to return to spiritual worlds, the regenerative "sleep" between lifetimes. On Earth, the immortals look at SunOne as a pathological suicide cult, teaching its children to kill themselves.

Against this backdrop, Miriam.  An artist and warrior, 200 years old in the body of a goddess, creating a massive artwork to the sun, final parting gift before dying.  She’s as close as any living system has ever been to the Sun, meditating, weaving in awe, mathematical revelations blossoming like lotus petals around her goddess body.

Miriam is married to Quinn, who was captured by, and escaped from, the Immortals – the authoritarian network that controls most of the solar system – three years earlier.  

The film opens with scenes of her solar artwork, intercut with Quinn’s battle – he has been exposed as a Bio AI of the, and the security of SunStationOne is attempting to contain him.  Massive battle, bodies that split into nanotech swarms, suck up tech from the space stations they crash into, battles seen through targeting systems, tech maps like massive tree systems.

Her artwork climaxes gloriously, in musical crescendo, multidimensional geometry unfolding around her, a vast hyperspherical tapestry, undulating sensually.  

Her military superior, Factimus, turns up, tells her that her husband is a BioAI copy from the Immortals, a spy who has been tapping her, and SunStationOne’s massive information systems.  Factimus is an asshole, but he will turn out to be a powerful friend, lion brother.  Factimus says they’re going to terminate the Quinn construct, he’s too dangerous.  She flips on Factimus, goes stone cold Pluto, says she will personally kill Factimus if he has Quinn killed.  

Miriam gets her tech liaison, Martin.  He’s a protogeek, all the latest enhancements, with this converse allstar retrofunk style.  

They visit Quinn in his holding cell, which he is rapidly hacking with some high art algorithms, or else access to more brute force computing power than in a million SunStations.  She breaks down in tears, devastated that the love of her life is a darkside Trojan.  He stops hacking, total sincerity, love to the depths of the Sun, says he doesn’t know what’s happening to him, who he is,  asks her to help him.  She goes deep within, tells him she will do everything to get him back, she’s talking to the real Quinn through his doppelganger.

Miriam does this massive ritual invocation, calling on her spiritual allies in the Sun, her angel lovers, to help her in the Quinn quest.  Factimus blocks all access, totally seals off Quinn.  She sets up a black operation with Martin, kind of cathartic transformation zone in abandoned space station, marked for recycling.  

They are using the Total Reality Catharsis Room, closed on all sides except open to the fire of the sun, crucible.  They invoke massive clearing forces, landing all of the real Quinn, landing his immortal spirit into the BioAI body.  There are two of them in this body, can’t cope.  Miriam is cracking open with Quinn, their love becoming stronger too, crazy, burning, Plutonic flame of love and destruction.  Her darkness is blooming as his light cracks through.

Martin is jealous of Quinn and Miriam, affects his ability to support her unreservedly.  Martin and Miriam fight, he destroys all the tech they’ve built together, he rips out the meters of nanofilament in his skull that linked him to their project.  Enraged, he spills to Quinn that he and Miriam were lovers while Quinn was imprisoned by the Immortals.

Quinn is blowing the whole TR system, like this crazy beast hacking the heavens, wild, blows the circuits on all SunStationOne’s realities and networks, total shutdown paralysis.  Factimus decides to terminate Quinn, sends the top tactical men to terminate him, says if Miriam fucks with them, kill her too, or contain her by any means necessary.  

The Immortals are launching a full scale attack, using the system takeover via Quinn.  Not just physical, they’re infiltrating TR on all levels.  Sun forces shut down their links to protect themselves, too dangerous to help Miriam

Quinn is transmuting the matter of the station into darkside tech, thrashing the special forces, terrorizing Miriam, torturing her, plutonic cat playing with mouse, Miriam grounding in the Sun, looking for a way out.  

Miriam’s world is disintegrating around her, she’s lost Marty, losing Quinn, he’s getting crazier, spiraling inward, she’s lost her people, she’s destroyed half of  SunStationOne by keeping Quinn alive.

This massive AI beast is being born through Quinn, using the abandoned station for raw material, it’s a massive dark bird, thrashing and eating whole biocomputer stations, creaming the tactical forces, belching bodies.  Quinn is riding the bird, he’s its nerve center, power extreme, heavy metal. 

Miriam dives into the Sun, Quinn’s dark bird pursuing her.  He wants to rip her open inside out, penetrate her with his darkness, sexual, violent.  They fight and fuck and tear each other, plunging deeper into into the Sun than is reasonably survivable.  Miriam’s Sun is burning Quinn’s darkness from the inside, purifying him.  

Together they use the sun as a fusion flame thrower, incinerating the massive hardware of the Immortals.  Miriam dies in this battle, sacrifices herself, saving the remaining SunStations.  The battle culminates in a spectacular solar display, reflecting and dwarfing Miriam’s death party masterwork at the movie’s start.  

Quinn and Factimus and Marty watch the solar flare artwork dance together.  Quinn, crying the tears of a warrior lover, darkside AI with massive spiritual forces behind him, destroyer turned savior.
